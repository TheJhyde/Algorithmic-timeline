TWITTER ALGORITHMIC TIMELINE EXTENSION

A Chrome extension that rearranges your timeline so the best tweets are at the top. Sometimes replaces particularly bad tweets with better tweets. Uses only the finest algorithms. Will probably not crash your computer, but not promises. Made for the [Stupid Shit Nobody Needs and Terrible Ideas Hackathon](http://www.stupidhackathon.com/) in 2016.
